# Community

Welcome to the Teaclave community. Here are several ways that you can get involved.

## Mailing Lists

We have a few mailing lists hosted by Apache:

- `dev@teaclave.apache.org`: A list for discussion on Teaclave development including design proposal, release
announcements, meetup schedules, and commnity voting, etc.
 [[Subscribe](mailto:dev-subscribe@teaclave.apache.org?subject=Subscribe) | [Unsubscribe](mailto:dev-unsubscribe@teaclave.apache.org?subject=Unsubscribe) | [Archive](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@teaclave.apache.org)]
- `commits@teaclave.apache.org`: Commit activities for all projects.
 [[Subscribe](mailto:commits-subscribe@teaclave.apache.org?subject=Subscribe) | [Unsubscribe](mailto:commits-unsubscribe@teaclave.apache.org?subject=Unsubscribe) | [Archive](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?commits@teaclave.apache.org)]

To subscribe or unsubscribe a mailing list, just send a blank email with any subject to one of
above address with the `-subscribe` or `-unsubscribe` suffix. For example, send
an email to `dev-subscribe@teaclave.apache.org` (or
`dev-unsubscribe@teaclave.apache.org`) to subscribe (or unsubscribe) the dev
mailing list.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take a very active stance in eliminating security problems in Teaclave. We
strongly encourage folks to report such problems to our private mailing list
first ([private@teaclave.apache.org](mailto:private@teaclave.apache.org)),
before disclosing them in a public forum.
