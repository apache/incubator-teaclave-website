responsibility, and a deeper commitment to the project's long-term success.

## Become a Committer of Apache Teaclave™

Anyone actively supporting the Apache Teaclave™ community across any CoPDoC area, 
**Community, Project, Documentation, and Code**, can become a committer. The 
CoPDoC model recognizes diverse contributions beyond just code.

Apache Teaclave™ operates as a meritocracy. Consistent, high-quality contributions and 
positive community engagement make you a strong candidate for committership. 
Becoming a committer means you are trusted with the project's direction and 
growth, not just commit access.

**What we look for in a Committer:**
- **Consistent contributions** over time in any form (code, documentation, 
  design discussions, issue triage, etc.).
- **Technical quality**: Clean, tested code or clear, user-oriented 
  documentation.
- **Community spirit**: Respectful collaboration, mentoring, and participation 
  in discussions.
- **Typical engagement levels**:
  - ~3 months of light activity  
  - ~2 months of medium activity  
  - ~1 month of solid activity

## Become a PPMC Member of Apache Teaclave™

Project Management Committee (PMC) members help guide the project's vision and 
governance. PPMC members are usually experienced committers who've shown 
leadership, deep engagement, and a long-term commitment to Teaclave. We value 
contributions across CoPDoC areas, with an emphasis on community maturity and 
project stewardship.

**What we look for in a PPMC Member:**
- **Sustained contributions** and active presence (e.g., roadmap discussions, 
  mentoring, organizing releases).
- **Strong understanding** of the project's goals and governance.
- **Community leadership**: Active on mailing lists, respectful in 
  collaboration, and helping shape the project direction.
- **Typical engagement levels**:
  - ~5 months of light activity  
  - ~4 months of medium activity  
  - ~3 months of solid activity

Both roles are voted on by the current PPMC and reflect the Apache Way: 
**merit, transparency, and community-driven growth**.
