# Becoming a Committer or PPMC Member of Apache Teaclave

Apache Teaclave is an open and inclusive community that welcomes all forms of 
contributionsâ€”from code and documentation to design discussions and community 
support. We follow the Apache Way and recognize sustained and meaningful 
contributions with committership or PPMC membership. These roles reflect trust, 
responsibility, and a deeper commitment to the project's long-term success.

## Become a Committer of Apache Teaclave

Anyone actively supporting the Teaclave community across any CoPDoC area, 
**Community, Project, Documentation, and Code**, can become a committer. The 
CoPDoC model recognizes diverse contributions beyond just code.

Teaclave operates as a meritocracy. Consistent, high-quality contributions and 
positive community engagement make you a strong candidate for committership. 
Becoming a committer means you are trusted with the project's direction and 
growth, not just commit access.

**What we look for in a Committer:**
- **Consistent contributions** over time in any form (code, documentation, 
  design discussions, issue triage, etc.).
- **Technical quality**: Clean, tested code or clear, user-oriented 
  documentation.
- **Community spirit**: Respectful collaboration, mentoring, and participation 
  in discussions.
- **Typical engagement levels**:
  - ~3 months of light activity  
  - ~2 months of medium activity  
  - ~1 month of solid activity

## Become a PPMC Member of Apache Teaclave

Project Management Committee (PMC) members help guide the project's vision and 
governance. PPMC members are usually experienced committers who've shown 
leadership, deep engagement, and a long-term commitment to Teaclave. We value 
contributions across CoPDoC areas, with an emphasis on community maturity and 
project stewardship.

**What we look for in a PPMC Member:**
- **Sustained contributions** and active presence (e.g., roadmap discussions, 
  mentoring, organizing releases).
- **Strong understanding** of the project's goals and governance.
- **Community leadership**: Active on mailing lists, respectful in 
  collaboration, and helping shape the project direction.
- **Typical engagement levels**:
  - ~5 months of light activity  
  - ~4 months of medium activity  
  - ~3 months of solid activity

Both roles are voted on by the current PPMC and reflect the Apache Way: 
**merit, transparency, and community-driven growth**.
