# Maturity Assessment For The Teaclave Ecosystem

This is a maturity assessment of Apache Teaclave based on the ASF project 
[maturity model](https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html).

It is used to evaluate the overall maturity for the project and the codebase 
it remains. It is also presented here to assist in the decision by the mentors, 
community, Incubator PMC, and ASF Board of Directors on Teaclave's graduation 
to a top-level Apache project.

## Status of this Document
The project has been filled out by the PPMC members of Apache Teaclave and 
welcomes any updates if necessary.

## Maturity Model Assessment

### Code Development (CD)

| ID | Description | Status |

| CD10 | The project produces Open Source software for distribution to the public, at no charge. | **YES** The project's source code is licensed under Apache License 2.0. |
| CD20 | Anyone can easily discover and access the project's code. | **YES** The [official website](https://teaclave.apache.org/) includes a GitHub link that can access the project's repository on GitHub directly. |
| CD30 | Anyone using standard, widely-available tools, can build the code in a reproducible way. | **YES** Comprehensive documentation is available in the [Quick Navigation Links](https://teaclave.apache.org/overview), guiding users through reproducible builds of the code.|
| CD40 | The full history of the project's code is available via a source code control system, in a way that allows anyone to recreate any released version. | **YES** The project uses `git`, and anyone can view the full history of the project via commit logs. |
| CD50 | The source code control system establishes the provenance of each line of code in a reliable way, based on strong authentication of the committer. When third parties contribute code, commit messages provide reliable information about the code provenance. | **YES** The project uses GitHub and is managed by Apache Infra, ensuring provenance of each line of code to a committer. Third-party contributions follow the contributing guidelines. |

### Licenses and Copyright (LC)

| ID | Description | Status |

| LC10 | The Apache License, version 2.0, covers the released code. | **YES** The LICENSE is in the GitHub repository. All source files are checked with CI to ensure that no LICENSE files are missing. |
| LC20 | Libraries that are mandatory dependencies of the project's code do not create more restrictions than the Apache License does. | **YES** All dependencies are listed. |
| LC30 | The libraries mentioned in LC20 are available as Open Source software. | **YES** All dependencies listed are available as open-source software. |
| LC40 | Committers are bound by an Individual Contributor Agreement (the "Apache iCLA") that defines which code they may commit and how they need to identify code that is not their own. | **YES** All committers have iCLAs. |

We are aware of the ASF policy regarding non-source distributions and follow it accordingly. |
| RE50 | The project documents a repeatable release process so that someone new to the project can independently generate the complete set of artifacts required for a release. | **YES** We document the Release Guide that the community can follow to make a new Apache Teaclave release. |

### Quality (QU)
