<h3><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i>&nbsp; Secure and Attestable</h3>
<p>
Teaclave adopts multiple security technologies to enable secure computing,
in particular, Teaclave uses Intel SGX to serve the most security-sensitive
tasks with hardware-based isolation, memory encryption and attestation.
Also, Teaclave is written in Rust to prevent memory-safety issues.
</p>
</div>

<div class="feature">
<h3><i class="fas fa-server"></i>&nbsp; Function-as-a-Service</h3>
<p> Teaclave is a
function-as-a-service platform supporting tasks like privacy-preserving machine
learning, private set intersection, and crypto computation. In addition,
developers can also write and execute Python function.
Teaclave supports both
general secure computing tasks and flexible multi-party secure computation.

<div class="feature">
<h3><i class="fas fa-grin"></i>&nbsp; Ease of Use</h3>
<p> Teaclave builds its
components in containers, therefore, it supports deployment both locally and
within cloud infrastructures. Teaclave also provides convenient endpoint APIs,
client SDKs and command line tools. </p>
</div>

<div class="feature">
<h3><i class="fas fa-shapes"></i>&nbsp; Flexible</h3>
<p> Components in Teaclave are designed in
modular, and features like remote attestation can be easily embedded in other
projects. In addition, Teaclave SGX SDK, Teaclave Java TEE SDK, and Teaclave
TrustZone SDK can also be used separately to write TEE apps for other purposes. </p>
