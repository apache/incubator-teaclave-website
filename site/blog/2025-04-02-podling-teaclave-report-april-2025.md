# Podling Teaclave Report - April 2025

## [Teaclave](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INCUBATOR/April2025#teaclave)
Teaclave is a universal secure computing platform, enabling writing
memory-safe trusted applications in Rust running inside Trusted Execution  
Environment.

Teaclave has been incubating since 2019-08-20. 
The Teaclave community is now working towards graduation.

### [Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INCUBATOR/April2025#three-most-important-unfinished-issues-to-address-before-graduating-13)

- Practice future releases by adhering to the newly proposed quarterly  
    release schedule.
- Finalize discussions with the community to assess the project's overall  
    maturity and readiness for graduation.
- Conduct a thorough self-assessment to ensure all Apache graduation  
    criteria are met.

### [Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INCUBATOR/April2025#are-there-any-issues-that-the-ipmc-or-asf-board-need-to-be-aware-of-13)
As the Teaclave community is working toward graduation, we appreciate any  
guidance on the process. Please let us know if there are any additional  
steps we should take beyond our current plan. Thank you.

### [How has the community developed since the last report?](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INCUBATOR/April2025#how-has-the-community-developed-since-the-last-report-13)

- A new committer was elected.
- Three new participants joined, and seven new projects were forked on  
    GitHub.
- Initiated collaboration with the OP-TEE community.

### [How has the project developed since the last report?](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INCUBATOR/April2025#how-has-the-project-developed-since-the-last-report-13)

- Made a release of the Teaclave TrustZone SDK with significant features.
- Established a quarterly release plan aligned with the OP-TEE community.

### [Date of last release:](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INCUBATOR/April2025#date-of-last-release-13)

We are in the process of releasing Apache Teaclave TrustZone SDK  
(incubating) v0.4.0 and are currently seeking binding votes from PMC  
members on the following thread:
https://lists.apache.org/thread/8mstnqpoo0hy1sy8f96dyrkyrmcdwz2z 

### [When were the last committers or PPMC members elected?](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INCUBATOR/April2025#when-were-the-last-committers-or-ppmc-members-elected-13)

2025-01-21

### Have your mentors been helpful and responsive?

We appreciate our mentors' support. However, we need help from PMC members  
to vote on our release, as delays in securing votes slow down the release  
process.

### [Is the PPMC managing the podling's brand / trademarks?](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INCUBATOR/April2025#is-the-ppmc-managing-the-podlings-brand--trademarks-13)

Are 3rd parties respecting and correctly using the podlings name and brand? If not what actions has the PPMC taken to correct this? Has the VP, Brand approved the project name?

Yes.
