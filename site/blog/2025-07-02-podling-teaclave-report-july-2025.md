As the Teaclave community works toward graduation, we welcome guidance 
along the process. We also invite any active IPMC members interested in the 
project to consider becoming mentors. Thank you.


### [How has the community developed since the last report?](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INCUBATOR/July2025#how-has-the-community-developed-since-the-last-report-13)

- We have a new mentor joining the project.

### [How has the project developed since the last report?](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INCUBATOR/July2025#how-has-the-project-developed-since-the-last-report-13)

- Initiated releasing Teaclave TrustZone SDK v0.5.0, pending for collecting binding votes in the general incubator mailing list.

### Have your mentors been helpful and responsive?

We have faced challenges with slow release cycles, partly due to the limited number of binding votes from mentors. To address this, we have invited new mentors to join the community and are actively engaging with contributors to ensure smoother release processes. We have also reached out to existing mentors and received positive responses and renewed support. We plan to continue this proactive approach in future releases to ensure timely and successful outcomes.

### [Is the PPMC managing the podling's brand / trademarks?](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INCUBATOR/July2025#is-the-ppmc-managing-the-podlings-brand--trademarks-13)

Are 3rd parties respecting and correctly using the podlings name and brand? If not what actions has the PPMC taken to correct this? Has the VP, Brand approved the project name?

Yes.
