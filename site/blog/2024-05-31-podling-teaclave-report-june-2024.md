## Teaclave

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  - Improve project structure and documentation
  - Grow the community (attracting more committers, contributors, users)
  - Publish Apache releases (resolving logistics on Apache release)
  
### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?
  
  None.
  
### How has the community developed since the last report?
  
  Since the last report, we have organized three monthly virtual
  meetups. For each meetup, we have write-ups published on the Teaclave
  blog <https://teaclave.apache.org/blog/>.
