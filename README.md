# Apache Teaclave (incubating) Website

The website is generated with the Docusaurus static site generator. Documentation
are fetched from the original repository.

You need to install the dependencies with `npm i` in `site` directory first. To
deploy the generated site, `gph-import` is also needed.

To preview the website, you can invoke:

```
make dev
```

To commit generated files to the `asf-staging` and `asf-site` branches you can call:

```
TEACLAVE_TARGET_DIR=xxx make staging
TEACLAVE_TARGET_DIR=xxx make site
```

This command will also copy the document generated by Teaclave. Therefore,
please `make doc` in Teaclave to generate documents and set the
`TEACLAVE_TARGET_DIR` environment to the target directory.

When pushing the branches to remote, the site are automatically deployed to the following links.
- `asf-staging`: https://teaclave.staged.apache.org (for preview)
- `asf-site`: https://teaclave.apache.org
